## Next version

* Added `Spring::Commands::Rake.environment_matchers` for matching
  rake tasks to specific environments.

## 0.0.8

* Renamed `spring test` to `spring testunit`.
* Implemented `spring rails` to replace `spring
  [console|runner|generate]`.
* `config/spring.rb` is only loaded in the server process, so you can
  require stuff from other gems there without performance implications.
* File watcher no longer pays attention to files outside of your
  application root directory.
* You can use the `listen` gem for less CPU intensive file watching. See
  README.
